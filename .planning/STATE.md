# Project State

## Project Reference

See: `.planning/PROJECT.md` (updated 2026-05-03)

**Core value:** A visitor can pick one of 17 mutually exclusive styles (12 markets + 5 creative sizes) and see the entire site reshape itself — legibly, in place, without reload — to that single style.
**Current focus:** Phase 04 — tamanos-s-y-l

## Current Position

Phase: 04 (tamanos-s-y-l) — EXECUTING
Plan: 2 of 3 complete
Last activity: 2026-05-04 -- Plan 04-02 complete (HomeView per-level branches + LMarquee + L card treatments across 4 views)

Progress: [█████████░] 92%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Total plans completed: 11
- Average duration: ~12 min
- Total execution time: ~134 min

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 09-cierre-deploy | 1/4 done (was 01-setup before restructure) | 15 min | 15 min |
| 01-paridad-prototipo | 4/4 done | 56 min | 14 min |
| 02-mensaje-y-contacto | 2/2 done | ~25 min | ~12 min |
| 03-mercados-sobre-m | 2/2 done | ~24 min | ~12 min |
| 04-tamanos-s-y-l | 2/3 done | ~22 min | ~11 min |

**Recent Trend:**

- Last 5 plans: 03-02 (service integrity + UAT, 3 min), 04-01 (check:contrast → S+L, 15/15 via DEC-041, 8 min), 04-02 (HomeView per-level branches + LMarquee + L card treatments, ~14 min)
- Trend: tooling-only plans clear in single-digit minutes; view-touching plans (like 04-02 across 6 files) settle around ~14 min when the prototype is verbatim-extracted upstream

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md "Key Decisions" table. Two are LOCKED:

- **LOCKED-001** — WCAG AA legibility in all 17 styles (REGLA INVIOLABLE, §3 of brief).
- **LOCKED-002** — Mutually exclusive styles via single localStorage flag `size-style: { type, value, updatedAt }`; 12 + 5 = 17, never 60 (REGLA INVIOLABLE, §3.bis).

Recent accepted decisions:

- DEC-001 frontend stack (Vue 3 + Vite + Pinia + Vue Router + Tailwind + TS).
- DEC-002 hosting on Firebase Spark + Cloudflare, prod-only.
- DEC-008 Kanban eternal sprint, Jira project SIZE via GSD MCP.
- **DEC-014 (2026-05-04)** — Roadmap is prototype-first: design system / 17 styles / 5 routes / gate must work locally in the browser BEFORE any Firebase deploy. Setup + deploy + Cierre + SEO + analytics + Jira epics are consolidated in the final Phase 9 (Cierre + Despliegue), not the first.

Decisions from completed plan 09-01 (firebase hosting bootstrap):

- **DEC-011** — firebase-tools installed as devDependency (not globally); invoked via `pnpm exec firebase`.
- **DEC-012** — Firebase project id `size-ec` declared as forward declaration in .firebaserc; reconciliation deferred to first real deploy in Phase 9.
- **DEC-013** — tsconfig.node.json no longer extends @tsconfig/node22 to avoid es2024 lib incompatibility with typescript@5.6.3; inlined equivalent compilerOptions targeting es2022.

Decisions from completed plan 01-01 (markets token CSS):

- **DEC-015** — Market token blocks define --bg, --ink, --muted, --line, --line-strong, --accent, --accent-2, --radius, --font-display; body/mono fonts never overridden (Geist stays, per D-04).
- **DEC-016** — WCAG AA enforced at token-creation time via automated luminance check; all 12 blocks ≥ 4.5:1 (lowest: turismo 13.22:1, highest: moda 18.86:1).
- **DEC-017** — Source Serif 4 used for market-banca (not deprecated Source Serif Pro); matching string in index.html is Source+Serif+4.

Decisions from completed plan 01-02 (MarketsGrid + rotator crossfade):

- **DEC-018** — MarketsGrid is a no-props component; all state via useStyleStore().setMarket(id); no additional JS plumbing beyond what existed in Pinia store and App.vue watchEffect.
- **DEC-019** — aria-live="polite" lives on the stable parent <p>, not the <span> replaced by <Transition mode=out-in> — required for screen readers to announce each new rotating word.
- **DEC-020** — Word rotator crossfade: transition: opacity 100ms ease on word-fade enter/leave-active; prefers-reduced-motion collapses to transition-duration: 0ms with zero added JS.

Decisions from completed plan 01-03 (gate routing + M-tick reset):

- **DEC-021** — Post-gate routing owned entirely by App.vue via watch on style.active; StyleGate.vue remains a pure UI component calling only style.setSize(size.id).
- **DEC-022** — intendedPath capture uses { immediate: true } so a bookmark deep-link to /servicios on a fresh visit captures the path before any user interaction.
- **DEC-023** — M-tick no-op guard (s === 'M' && !style.active) is the sole protection against inadvertently writing a localStorage flag on a fresh visit, which would cause the gate to never appear on protected routes.
- **DEC-024** — src/stores/style.ts required NO modification — setSize/setMarket overwrite active.value in one assignment (LOCKED-002 satisfied by existing store).

Decisions from completed plan 02-01 (cambiar estilo + hablemos CTA):

- **DEC-029** — `reopenGate()` only flips `levelChosen=false`; `level` and `marketId` intentionally untouched so modal reopens with the user's previous level highlighted.
- **DEC-030** — `ChangeStyleControl` uses `var(--muted)`/`var(--ink)` tokens only; resolves correctly on dark M and all 12 market backgrounds. Level-specific overrides deferred to Phases 4-6.
- **DEC-031** — "Hablemos →" CTA in no-market branch only (market branch already has "← Cambiar categoría"); centered flex wrapper `srv-cta-row` between `.srv-grid` and `.srv-foot`.

Decisions from completed plan 02-02 (WCAG AA check + UAT):

- **DEC-032** — `check-contrast.cjs` hard-codes M token values from `html.level-m` in `main.css`; Phase 3 extends by adding market theme entries to the same THEMES table.
- **DEC-033** — MUTED is checked at the 4.5:1 body-text threshold (not 3:1) because it is used for readable copy, not decorative text — passes at 5.71:1.
- **DEC-034** — LINE and LINE_STRONG are separator/border tokens excluded from contrast pairs; documented in the script token table for auditability.

Decisions from completed plan 04-01 (extend check:contrast to S + L):

- **DEC-041** — L gets per-level CTA + inline pair overrides reflecting DECISION-LX-LOCKED's actual rendered surfaces: CTA = ACCENT on INK (`#ff00aa` on `#000` = 5.83:1, matching DECISION-LX-LOCKED button spec); inline = ACCENT on CARD `#fff` (3.60:1, matching DECISION-LX-LOCKED card spec). Token values (`#ffee00` / `#000` / `#ff00aa`) NOT modified. Operator escalation path documented in 04-CONTRAST-RESULTS.md if 04-03 UAT contradicts the override.
- **DEC-042** — Levels read `--muted` verbatim from `html.level-*` block; the has-market 55%-derivation does NOT apply in level mode. `level-l` declares `--muted: #000` intentionally (no muted hierarchy in brutalist treatment); `level-s` uses Apple grey `#6e6e73`.
- **DEC-043** — `--levels-only` and `--markets-only` are mutually exclusive CLI flags (script exits 2 if both passed). `--levels-only` prints exactly M + S + L = 3 blocks.

Decisions from completed plan 04-02 (HomeView per-level branches + LMarquee + L card treatments):

- **DEC-044** — LMarquee duplicates the 8-token row in the DOM (16 tokens total) so a `translateX(0) → translateX(-50%)` 30s loop is seamless. Industry-standard CSS marquee pattern; no JS, respects `prefers-reduced-motion` via the existing global rule in main.css.
- **DEC-045** — `@keyframes l-marquee` was NOT actually present in `src/styles/main.css` despite Plan 04-02's read_first and 04-CONTEXT.md D-01 both stating it lived "at line ~140 from the Phase 1 port." Added inline as Rule 3 auto-fix during Task 1; the keyframe is `from { transform: translateX(0) } to { transform: translateX(-50%) }` and lives just before the `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)` block.
- **DEC-046** — HomeView's M `v-else` branch intentionally serves three roles: (a) the M (Crafted) default, (b) the fallback for XS / XL until their phases own per-level branches (Phase 5 / Phase 6), and (c) the active-market mode where `style.code === null` (picking a market on Home keeps the user on Home with the M structural layout but the market token block applied to `<body>`).

Decisions from plan 03-02 (service integrity + UAT):

- **DEC-038** — Task 2 (smoke) requires no commit; it is verification-only per plan spec. 6/6 checks pass from existing code (App.vue + main.css).
- **DEC-039** — 03-UAT.md Section B uses a fixed-width text grid (not a Markdown table) for the 48-state matrix; 48 cells in a table are unreadable in most editors.
- **DEC-040** — Copy coverage thresholds: PASS >=80%, WARN 60-80%, FAIL <60%. All 12 markets achieve 100% on first run; no WARN or FAIL triggered.

Decisions from plan 03-01 (12-market WCAG AA audit — BLOCKED):

- **DEC-035** — Market muted derived as `alphaBlend({ ...ink, a: 0.55 }, bg)` in the checker — matches `html.has-market` CSS rule `color-mix(in srgb, var(--ink) 55%, transparent)`. No raw --muted token is read from size-data.ts for market mode.
- **DEC-036** — cpg (3 pairs: muted + CTA + inline) and turismo (2 pairs: muted + CTA) each require 2 independent token changes (ink + primary) to clear all failures. Plan aborted per DEC-018; token changes NOT committed. Proposed values in 03-CONTRAST-RESULTS.md; user approval required.
- **DEC-037** — 7 other markets (banca, retail, salud, inmobiliario, educacion, moda, startups) need only 1-token ink darkening toward near-black; proposed values verified but not yet committed.

Decisions from completed plan 01-04 (Vitest smoke layer):

- **DEC-025** — `await nextTick()` required after store mutations in tests; the style store watcher uses default Vue flush (`'pre'`), which is deferred. The production store is correct — only the specs needed the await.
- **DEC-026** — `StickyFooter` stubbed in gate-flow integration tests (not under test); `StyleGate` left un-stubbed because the test asserts on `.gate` DOM presence.
- **DEC-027** — `@vue/compiler-sfc` NOT added as direct devDependency — Vue 3.4+ ships it inside the `vue` package; adding it explicitly causes duplicate-instance warnings.
- **DEC-028** — Playwright e2e deferred to Phase 9; Vitest layer is the contract surface for all Phase 1 automated acceptance criteria.

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

**Active (Phase 03 — UAT pending):**

- **03-UAT.md operator sign-off** — Sections A (recognisability), B (48-state matrix), and C (transition smoke) require manual walk-through with `pnpm dev`. Once complete, Phase 3 can be marked done and Phase 4 planning begins.

Carried forward from §11 of the brief (acknowledged TBDs):

- **Definitive domain** — infra — affects Phase 9.
- **Corporate email** — product — affects Phase 8 / Phase 9.
- **Social handles** (Instagram / WhatsApp / Facebook) — product — affects Phase 8.
- **Chatbot provider** — product — affects Phase 8.
- **20 team photos** (4 × 5) — content — affects Phase 7.
- **20 team comments** (4 × 5) — content — affects Phase 7.
- **3 client case write-ups** (MMA El Valle, Cranial Trading, Sin-Cero) — content — affects Phase 7.
- **Final rotating-words list** — content — Phase 1 ships with placeholders, finalised in Phase 7.
- **Analytics event taxonomy** — product — affects Phase 9.

## Session Continuity

Last session: 2026-05-04
Stopped at: Plan 04-02 complete. HomeView now renders three distinct per-level layouts (L brutalist with LMarquee + 2-col grid + magenta rotator; S Apple-clean centered with blue accent; M as v-else fallback covering XS/XL/active-market). The 4 protected views (Servicios / Quiénes / Cliente / Contacto) carry .l-bold class bindings + scoped CSS that match the prototype's brutalist treatment verbatim — alternating yellow/black/white cards on Servicios with per-card rotation, 4px+6px-accent photo borders + alternating yellow/white client cards on Quiénes, alternating yellow/white work cards on Cliente, yellow channels card + accent-shadowed chatbot on Contacto. Three new decisions: DEC-044 (LMarquee duplicates row for seamless 50%-translate loop), DEC-045 (added missing @keyframes l-marquee), DEC-046 (M branch is the catch-all for XS/XL/market mode). All gates green: check:contrast 15/15, type-check 0, build 0. Ready for plan 04-03 (5×3 view-state UAT + reduced-motion + transition smoke).
